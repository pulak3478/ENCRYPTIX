Titanic Survival Prediction
This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a passenger survived the tragic sinking of the Titanic. The dataset contains information about individual passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The steps involved include data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which is available here. It contains the following columns:

PassengerId: An identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
Pclass: The passenger's class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
Name: The name of the passenger.
Sex: The gender of the passenger.
Age: The age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
Ticket: The ticket number.
Fare: The fare paid by the passenger.
Cabin: The cabin number.
Embarked: The port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).


Project Steps

Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Dropping unnecessary columns

Feature Selection:
Selecting relevant features for model training

Model Training:
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Training a logistic regression model

Model Evaluation:
Evaluating the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
